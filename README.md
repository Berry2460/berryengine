# Berry Engine
A small work in progress 3D engine.
## What can it do?
So far just basic 3D shapes, lighting and transformations.
## What's next?
- Culling.
- Clean up some functions, variables and Objects.
- Better transformations.
- Translations of models onto a map (perhaps and editor of sorts?).
- Improved shaders (shadows, reflections, etc).
## Why?
Purely a learning experience.
